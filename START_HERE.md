# 🚀 START HERE - React Version

## Your website has been converted to React! 🎉

### Quick Start (Copy & Paste)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

---

## What Just Happened?

Your HTML website is now a **modern React application** with:
- ⚡ Fast hot-reload development
- 🎨 Component-based architecture  
- 🚀 Optimized production builds
- 📱 Better performance
- 🔧 Easier to maintain

---

## File Structure

```
Your Project/
├── src/              ← React components (your new code)
├── public/           ← Game HTML files (your old code)
├── package.json      ← Dependencies
└── index.html        ← Main template
```

---

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies (first time only)
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Home Page** (`src/pages/Home.jsx`)
   - Shows game cards
   - Handles navigation
   - Animated background

2. **Game Routes** (`src/pages/MarsTown.jsx`, `SpaceRafter.jsx`)
   - Load your original HTML games
   - From the `public/` folder

3. **Router** (`src/App.jsx`)
   - Manages navigation
   - No page reloads!

---

## Your Games

Both games work exactly as before:
- ✅ Mars Town Builder → `/mars-town`
- ✅ Space Rafter → `/space-rafter`

The HTML files are in the `public/` folder.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test both games**: Click the cards
3. **Deploy**: See `REACT_README.md` for deployment options
